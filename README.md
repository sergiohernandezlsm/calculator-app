## Presentation
This is a simple application to calculate 2 credits. The library used to handle the global state of the application was Redux. We have a complete test coverage that can be run using this command npm run test:coverage
```
$ npm run test:coverage
```

## Design
The design is clear with a simple layout managed using Sass with a global file to implement basic styles using variables and mixing. The UI is responsive as requested, so will adapt to the different size devices available.

## Technologies
This application was developed with React and typescript to enjoy more features of es6. The application is dockerized, this wasn't part of the initial request but I believe it's a good practice to do at the beginning if posible.

## Test
For the test I used jest and enzyme. In terms of testing, this is where I want to learn a lot more because it's really cool. Also in terms of developing I have so much left to improve and keep learning but I am determined and enjoying it.

## Feedback
This excercise was fun from the beginning and was a good challenge for me to test my skills. I would really appreciate your honest feedback as I am keen to understand areas that I need to work to improve.
